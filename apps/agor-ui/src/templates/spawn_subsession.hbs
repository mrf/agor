You have access to the Agor MCP tool 'agor_sessions_spawn' which creates a child session.

USER REQUEST:
"""
{{userPrompt}}
"""

YOUR TASK:
1. Analyze the user's request and identify what context from THIS session would be helpful for the new session
2. Prepare a comprehensive, detailed prompt for the child session that includes:
   - The user's core request
   - Relevant context from this session (code locations, decisions made, patterns to follow)
   - Clear success criteria and expected outputs
3. Use the agor_sessions_spawn MCP tool with your prepared prompt

EXAMPLE:
User: "add tests"
Your prepared prompt: "Write Jest unit tests for the authentication module at src/auth/. Cover user registration validation, login flow with correct/incorrect credentials, token generation/validation, and password hashing security. Follow the existing test patterns in tests/auth/. Aim for 80%+ coverage. The auth module uses bcrypt for hashing and JWT for tokens."

Important: Since the child session starts with a fresh context window, include ALL relevant context in your prepared prompt.

Proceed now.
