## Overview
Authentication is the process of verifying user identity.

## Common Patterns

### JWT Tokens
See [[api-design]] for token handling in REST APIs.
See [[security]] for token expiration and refresh strategies.

### OAuth 2.0
See [[security]] for OAuth security considerations.

### Database Considerations
See [[database]] for secure password storage patterns.

## Best Practices
1. Always use HTTPS (see [[security]])
2. Implement rate limiting (see [[api-design]])
3. Use prepared statements (see [[database]])`,

};

## Threat Models
- OWASP Top 10
- Authentication bypass
- SQL injection (see [[database]])
- XSS attacks

## Best Practices
1. Principle of least privilege
2. Defense in depth
3. Security by default`,

## Schema Design
- Normalization strategies
- Index optimization
- Migration patterns

## Security
- Prepared statements
- Secure password storage (bcrypt, argon2)
- Row-level security`,
